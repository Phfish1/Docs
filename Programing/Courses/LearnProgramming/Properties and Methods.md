### Properties

A property is an already computed atribute. like eg: length of a string

``` js
name = "Philip";
name.length
```

name.length = 6


### Methods

Methods perform operations on your object. It is like a behaviour or instructions to perform tasks on your object

``` js
name = "philip";
name.toUpperCase();
```

`.toUpperCase()` copies the string and makes it all UPPER case.

A Method is a Function being called ON SOMETHING. Like in this case called on the string variable `name`

`.toUpperCase()` is a function without needing any parameters

### Comparison

In object Oriented Programming (the most common) **OOP** We deal with **messages** and **objects**.
- The object is the data
- The message is what "starts" or triggers the object / data
	( or else the data would just hang around doint nothing )

An **Object** consists of: 
- State Data
	| Represented as PROPERTIES
- Behavior
	| Represented as METHODS

Example:
- Behaviour
	| The object WINDOW could have METHODS like `.OPEN()` or `.CLOSE()`
- State Data
	| And PROPERTIES like whether it is opened or closed. `.isOpen` | `isClosed`
