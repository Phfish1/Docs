# Variables 1.

Used to store data for further manipulation

``` Js
let age 18
```

age = VARIABLE_NAME
18 = VALUE

**ALWAYS** Use Describing variable names. If not your gonna spend more time reading code than actually coding.

Modifying variables. let/int whatever is only used first to declare the variable

``` js
let age = 17

age = 18
```

### Hardcoding

Make sure to not hardcode. Setting a fixed value. Much rather gather data which then is modified eg:

``` js
let year = 2023
let nexdDecade = year + 10
```

Now when next year comes around you will only have to change the variable `year`
