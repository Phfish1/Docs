# Lesson 1

#### H(left) J(Down) K(Up) L(Right)

>x = delete on cursor

>i = Insert

>a = Append

# **Need to know**

>dd = Deletes hole line

>u = Undo

>U = fixes hole line

>CTRL + R = Redo

# Lesson 2

##### Operators:

>d = Delete

>w = To the start of next word
$ = To end of current Line
e = To end of curren word


>dw = Delete Word

> d$ = Delete Rest of line 

>de = Delete rest of word

>d0 = deletes line form end to start

### Counts And [ Motion ]

---

>0 = Start of line

>$ = End of line

---

#### Count
f.eks:
```
2w (Will type w 2 times)
9w (Wil jump 9 words ahead)
3e
0
```

```
d2w ( Deletes 2 Words)
```

d = operator
2 = count
w = motion

Operator: is what to do
Number: repeat motion
Motion: "Moves" over the text (w = move over Word)

> **Operator [number] Motion**
